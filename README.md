# Chatbot (Learning Project: React)

This is a small **Chatbot project** I built while following a tutorial and added some adjustments of my own. Ofcourse I didin't only use this tutorial to learn, because for multiple things it proved to be insufficent. Thank God reddit, Stack Overflow, GeekforGeeks and simmilar sites exist.  

My main reasons for doing this were:

1. I wanted to make a chatbot because itâ€™s cool ðŸ˜Ž  
2. I wanted to learn the basics, tips and tricks of using **React**

This project is **not my own creation** - it is based on a tutorial I followed step by step.  
I treated it as a learning exercise to get comfortable with Reactâ€™s concepts.

## Features
- Simple chat interface with user and bot messages
- Input field and send button
- Displays messages from both sides with avatars
- Clean React component structure (`App`, `ChatInput`, `ChatMessages`, `Message`)

---

## What I Learned
- How to structure a React project
- Using **components** to split UI
- Handling **state** with `useState`
- Updating lists of messages dynamically
- Rendering lists with `.map()`
- Passing props between components
- ChatGPT can make good README.md files

---

## Setup & Run
1. Clone the repo or copy the files
2. Install dependencies if you use a bundler like Vite or CRA
3. Open `index.html` in the browser **or** run your dev server
4. Start chatting with the demo bot!

## Notes
- The chatbot responses are **scripted** (tutorial logic) - not a real AI yet
- To connect to ChatGPT or another AI model, you would need a backend that talks to an API safely
